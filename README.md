Swingy is a project produced by Academy+Plus where we develop a rudimentary text based game with a focus on a graphical user interface and related software design patterns in Java. 
PDF instructions here: [Swingy.en.pdf](https://github.com/kmarchan/JavaSwingy/files/3430515/Swingy.en.pdf)

The game is fun exercise to practice java and object oriented programming it is by no means perfect. We were tasked with utilizing a MVC design pattern which I am certain I have not done correctly. 

Compile and run the program with ```./running.txt``` maven will need to be installed
The next few images show the views of the game however it can be played in terminal and in the GUI.

The main menu:

After the Hero has been created or Hero selected from the saved list the game can begin:

When the hero occupies the same space as a monster the fight view will show. The Hero has two options fight or run:

When the hero kills the monster there is a chance they will drop an artifact. Either a helm, weapon or armor.
If in item is dropped there is only an option to equip or not:
